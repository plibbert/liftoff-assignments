# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A few months ago, my mom took cookies into my sister's work (a gifts and goods shop) during a paint class. They were superbowl cookies - and two of the ladies attending asked if she was taking orders (no, but she did anyway). This has happened a few more times since and she has also been informally added to the payroll of the shop to provide baked goods and snacks for open house events and the like. She has since teamed up with my aunt to create a small baking business and now they need a website - cue me and my LaunchCode class project! 

I'm building my mom and aunt a multi-page (4-6 pages) website to help drum up business, provide a space for order and catering requests, and to encourage them to stay up-to-date with their social media presence and trying new baking things. At this point, vistors to the page will be able to read a little about the company and the two bakers, view images of past bakes, search for recipies they share/use, check a calendar of upcoming events, and request a bake or catering service. 

### Features
Search - users will be able to search for recipes by keyword or type of bake (cookies, bread, cakes, etc.)
Email Form - users will be able to fill out a quick form which generates and email to be sent to the account for the business. The form will request basic information about the service requested (ordering or catering), date requested, and when/how to contact. 
Newsletter signup - users will be taken to a brief form to sign up for an occasional newsletter. Emails will be stored in a database.
Calendar of Events - pulling from a database of information, the calendar should be up-to-date with upcoming events.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I would like this website to be mobile friendly as well as accesible. I will need to learn how to create a responsive design. I will also need to research accessibility standards so that the website is capable of successful use by those who need screen readers and those with vision issues.
